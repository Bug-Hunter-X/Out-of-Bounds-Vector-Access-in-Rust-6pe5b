This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Rust: out-of-bounds vector access.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to access an element of a vector using an index that is greater than or equal to the vector's length. This will result in a panic. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that uses the `get` method to safely handle potential out-of-bounds access.
